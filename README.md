- Menu-driven interface for viewing and updating data  
- Code is split across multiple files for organization  

## Skills Used
- C++ programming  
- File input/output (`ifstream` / `ofstream`)  
- Breaking code into multiple `.cpp` and `.h` files  

## How to Compile & Run
```bash
g++ *.cpp -o trainer.exe
./trainer.exe
