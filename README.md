# Pokémon Trainer OOP Project

This project is a C++ program that simulates a Pokémon trainer. It was built as part of my Programming Foundations I coursework to practice **object-oriented programming (OOP)** and **file handling**.

## Features
- `Trainer` class with constructors, copy constructor, and destructors.
- File-driven data loading for trainer and Pokémon information.
- Demonstrates object-oriented design, encapsulation, and dynamic memory.
- Menu-driven interface for interacting with trainer data.

## Skills Demonstrated
- C++ classes and objects  
- File I/O (`ifstream` / `ofstream`)  
- Copy constructors and memory management  
- Modular programming and header files  

## How to Compile & Run
```bash
g++ *.cpp -o trainer.exe
./trainer.exe
